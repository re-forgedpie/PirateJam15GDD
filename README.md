## INTRODUCTION

	Initial Game Summary Pitch
	
	In the shadow of giants is a Survival Fighting game about being overshadowed by everything else. The world does not care about you and need to shadow others larger than you to survive. The gameplay will be minimal only comprising of one or two key features focusing on the experince.

## Inspiration
	
	Sekiro Shadows Die Twice
	
	Sekiro is an inspiration on its overall direction and composition of game mechanics. Although Sekiro is known as a difficult souls like game.  The game revolves around being an underdog- Exploring and fighting bosses it also rewards players in stealth with easier take downs, instant kills. The game also draws on alchemy with it’s plot, prosthetic arm and skill tree.

	Overwatch

	Overwatch is a Multiplayer Team game featuring a cast of characters. In order to win, the player needs to coordinate with their team to win the fight. While Overwatch has beautiful visual design of characters and world. It has many other flaws. From this game I’m taking inspiration of how it feels to play as a support character in a team fight. In order to win the game you need to be patient and wait for other key roles (Eg Tank or DPS) before then engaging. The Abilities of the supporting roster (Eg Ana, Zen) Also provide some inspiration of what limitations and strengths a character could have. This is because these characters can have a huge impact on the team fight but very rarely dictate many elements of the fight.
	
	Minecraft
	
	Minecraft is a famous survival game. Although the game largely revolves around building, I take inspiration from the simplicity of the survival elements of the game that have defined a genre of games. Hunger, resources, materials and crafting. It gives the player simple and understandable tasks and openness to approach tasks. I think however, that this games design has large pitfalls to avoid in the creation & design of the game. (eg Goals, Scope, open world and tension)
	
	The Forever Winter
	
	The Forever Winter is a game not yet released. It’s primary appeal is the “you are nothing” genre.  This game was one of the first games I thought about when brainstorming for this game jam. That is because while the games premise is “you are nothing” It features Giant Mechs and more which you need to play and scavange around for resources. I think this fits strongly with the “Shadow” theme as to win, you must carefully navigate an active battle field dwarfed by everything else. You need to remain in the shadows, wait for the right time before darting out to scavenge some parts
	
	Legends of Zelda
	
	The Legends of Zelda are a series of games which serve as inspiration for the artistic direction of the game. Legends of Zelda are a fantasy game series featuring link with magic beasts and a number of magical items

# Player Experince

	In a Simple area for the player to navigate like that of a dungeon themed like Legends of Zelda. The player will explore this dungeon like area avoiding conflict with stronger Enemys (Giants). Lurk in the shadows while collecting survival resources. The player must manage their resources, kite enermy factions while aiming to achieve the primary goal of the game (Making a phlosiphers stone). The player will be given very few mechanics making it quick and easy to pick up the game but provide complex options of how the game plays out rewarding knowledge and brave risk management. (Knowledge of Enemy behaviour, map knowledge etc)

Platform
	
	To comply with the game jam rules, the game will target the browser. This limits some game  engine options and performance envolope.

Development software
	- Godot
  - logic pro x
  - Mixamo
 
	
Genre
	- Survival, action

<a name="Concept" />

The Player Needs to hide in the shadows to collect resources. These resources are also used & desired by the enemys leading to a risk-reward situation.
By navigating around the world while being chased the Enemys can adapt to the player or target their future poistion so that the player always feels under pressure. not quite knowing where the next threat will be.

The idea of "Shadows of giants" comes from not being capable to take them head on. Their strength, size and number puts the player at a disadvange already,

To tie into the "Alchemy" while the player cannot combat them directly items and other effects the player can use will lend into this theme. (inc Player goal)

## End of Jam Summary

This game took more inspiration from Pacman and Hello Neibour (Alphas 1-2) than those listed in the end as the game changed over time to better reflect what I had been learning and the diffculty in making this game.

This Jam has been very challenging spending around 38hrs over the two weeks. I've wanted to give up a number of times as it's been an insurmountable challenge in knowledge gaps and time management. In additoion dispite aiming for a "minimal" the scope of those features are large.
I think I've learnt alot about what to worktowards when prototyping as I had begun working too much on fleshing the whole game out. This is particularly noteable as around 24 hours where dedicated to implimenting the 3rd person camera and Inventory system. The remaining time (14 hrs) was spent on Models, importing debugging model importing, learning about textures and more.

Implementing these and making this game has taught me a huge amount about execution on a game design. Espcially about Godot having never used it before.
Taking part in this Jam I have learnt significantly about Godots Signal systems, UI, Resources and Game models (Eg fbx, obj etc)

The Jam sadly became a solo effort.
Dispite best efforts. The Music producer unfortuntely was unable to provide their work before the end of the Jam. The QA player unfortunely had a difficult to fix issue preventing only them from playing the game on Itch. There is little that can be done about this However, all are still excited & interested in the game.
